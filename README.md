# Hangman Game

Introduction

This game is the first project I made using HTML, Javascript and CSS during my software immersive course in General Assembly. I chose to make Hangman as it is one of my favourite games to play back when I was a child. What appealed to me about this game is the suspense and tension created from guesssing each letter of the hidden word. Weather it be getting the right or wrong word, there is that dread and fear that the letter you pick might be wrong. This intensifies as you are down to your last few guesses and that makes for a thrilling and tense ending to the game.
